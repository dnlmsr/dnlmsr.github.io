work as a firmware developer in <a href=http://www.ewo.com>ewo</a> where my
daily work consists of firmware development for smart street lights,
but also software development for the production and configuration of
the smart nodes (you can find more info in the <a href=#work-ewo>work
section</a>).</p><p>In my free time, you can find me running in the mountains, growing new
technical skills but most importantly being a volunteer firefighter 🚒.</p><h2 id=-technical-knowledge>🛠️ Technical knowledge</h2><p>My technical skills are all centered around electronics and programming.</p><h3 id=-electronics>💡 Electronics</h3><p>I studied electronics and automation in high school, after that I took a
2-year course in automation and mechatronics, where I also found
interests in production management and lean production methods. Here are
some skills I know:</p><ul><li>PCB design, mostly done with KiCad</li><li>PCB production and production management</li><li>SMD and THT soldering</li><li>Embedded boards programming</li></ul><h3 id=-informatics>🖥️ Informatics</h3><p>I have always found the IT world to be fascinating, as a fact I spend lot of my
free time discovering new things on this subject. I am also a fan of open source
software and anything that revolves around it, and I always try to find open
source alternatives to get my job done. These below are some tools and programs
I learned in my lifetime:</p><ul><li>Linux</li><li>Git</li><li>KiCad</li><li>C for embedded systems (mostly using the Arduino framework)</li><li>LaTeX</li><li>Python</li><li>Rust (beginner level, still learning it)</li><li>HTML & CSS (beginner level)</li></ul><p>I use Linux (arch btw) as my daily driver, and I&rsquo;m pretty confident with the
tools revolving around it.</p><h2 id=-education>🎓 Education</h2><h3 id=alta-formazione-professionale-in-mechatronics-and-automation-2018---2020>Alta Formazione Professionale in Mechatronics and Automation (2018 - 2020)</h3><p>I also took a 2 year course in Mechatronics and Automation. This course
alternates lessons with 8 months of internship (you can find more info
in the <a href=#work-blm>work section</a>) so not only studying is involved but I
also managed to build some work experience.</p><p>My thesis revolved around the digitization process of the production
facility and lean production methods used in the factory.</p><h3 id=high-school-degree-in-electronics-and-automation-2015---2018>High school degree in Electronics and Automation (2015 - 2018)</h3><p>I graduated in 2018 in Electronics and Automation, my thesis was about a
project of a Rubik&rsquo;s cube solver, where I covered most of the
electronics and programming.</p><h2 id=-work-experience>👨🏼‍💻 Work experience</h2><h3 id=work-ewo>ewo GmbH/S.r.l. (October 2022 - now)</h3><p>I am currently working on the development of smart IoT nodes which
control new smart street lights which make use of various sensors. I
also develop and maintain the software used for testing the firmware.</p><h3 id=work-leos>LEOS S.r.l. (January 2021 - August 2022)</h3><p>I worked in a production environment where I managed the production
and quality assurance of the electronics which control laser heads
used for spectroscopy purposes. I also maintained the company network
and documentation system, which is based on the free and open source
software <a href=https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki>mediawiki</a>. Other
tasks included:</p><ul><li>Production of electronic controllers;</li><li>Managing the controller software driven by Linux;</li><li>Programming embedded electronics;</li><li>Inventory management;</li><li>Writing instructions for production.</li></ul><h3 id=work-blm>BLM group (8 months in 2019 - 2020)</h3><p>I worked as a intern in Adige S.p.a. where I performed various tasks in
the production facility of laser cutting machinery. The tasks include:</p><ul><li>Inventory management</li><li>Production of mechanical pieces with CNC machines</li><li>Followed the full production start to finish (both mechanical and
electric) of a laser tube-cutting machine</li></ul><p>Most importantly, I followed the digitization process of the production
facility, which aimed to better estimate the production status of each
machine. Furthermore I took part in the realization of a proof of
concept of digitization of the building procedures.</p><h3 id=ace-control-systems-ltd-august-2017>ACE control systems LTD (August 2017)</h3><p>I worked as an intern in Ireland which was part of a school project. I
worked in a workshop mostly doing cabling of electrical cabinets.</p><h3 id=tretec-srl-june-2017>Tretec S.r.l. (June 2017)</h3><p>I worked as an intern in a PCB production company, where I learned the
basics of THT and SMD soldering. Furthermore this was the first time I
managed to see the production and testing process of PCBs.</p><h2 id=-languages>🌍 Languages</h2><ul><li>🇮🇹 Italian (native)</li><li>🇬🇧 English (C1 level)</li></ul><h2 id=-certificates>📜 Certificates</h2><h3 id=driving-licences>Driving licences</h3><ul><li>🚗 B</li><li>🚚 C (almost done)</li></ul><h3 id=languages>Languages</h3><ul><li>🇬🇧 Cambridge CAE</li></ul><h2 id=-recognition>🏅 Recognition</h2><ul><li><strong>Most innovative project</strong>, <em>First Lego League Italian Finals</em>, march 2016</li></ul><h2 id=-contacts>📧 Contacts</h2><ul><li>Email: <a href=mailto:dnlmsr0@gmail.com>dnlmsr0@gmail.com</a></li><li>LinkedIn: <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/dan-mos>dan-mos</a></li><li>GitHub: <a href=https://github.com/dnlmsr>dnlmsr</a></li></ul></main><footer><p>Made with ❤️‍🩹 Copyright © 2022-2023 Daniele Moser
