Over the course of my journey in Linux I discovered lots of interesting tools
for production or for everyday tasks. But none of them compared to what Git gave
me, and I'd even go as far as saying that it completely changed my perspective
of working on a PC.

This is not a guide on how to use Git, there are tons of good guides out there,
this article is about my point of view on Git.
#+end_info

* Example
Let's say you're working on a software project, or even a project which isn't
necessarily code based such as a writing or a mechanical or electrical drawing.
You start your project, edit it, refine it and you're done! And you didn't even
need Git for this! Now let's say something doesn't look right with it: you copy
your base file, probably save it as ~final_version~, edit it, and you're happy
with it. Now let's iterate this last step 5 times until you get to the
~trust_me_most_final_version~. Great! Now you have your project folder cluttered
of final versions, but how does someone else know which is the right one? Let's
take this a step further, you remove something from your final version and you
save it, then you realize that part wasn't so bad, how are you gonna recover it?
Are you going to manage your projects like this or have a tool which deals with
this headache for you?

If you wish to keep working like this, you probably won't go far away without
losing versions or data. That's why VCSs (Version Control Systems) exist,
they're there to save hours of headaches trying to look for that particular
change you probably even deleted. There are lots of VCSs out there like
Mercurial, CVS, SVN and others, but the most popular and well known is *Git*.

* What does Git solve
Git basically takes care of versioning your project for you, without even
noticing. Actually, you have to tell him when to store a new version of the
file, but you surely won't have tons of final versions in your project
directory. I will now list some problems it solves:

** Saving every version of the file
Well, that's basically what Git is intended for.

** Showing a log of the versions
Git can show you a log of all the versions and who uploaded it.

** Showing the difference between two versions
Git can show you what you added and deleted to a file

** Manage multiple files
Imagine applying the example before with two different files, I won't even
imagine the mess it would create.

** Working with other people
You'll probably have to deal with working with other people once in a while, Git
makes it easy to do it, by working around what is called a centralized
repository. As an example:
1. John edits the projects
2. John uploads the changes on the central repository (or =origin=)
3. Joe pulls the latest changes from ~origin~
4. Joe edits the project
5. Joe uploads the changes on ~origin~

This method ensures two things:
- The central repository is always up to date
- If the central repository stops working both John and Joe still have the full
  history of the project without the need of an online connection

This is just an example of the simplest workflow you can use. There are many of
them on the internet or you can come up with your own. If you are working on a
relatively big project I usually suggest using the [[https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model][git-flow]] method by Vincent
Driessen.

** Branching
Now we're going into the rabbit hole of this tool. Let's say you have a base
version of your project, but you want two different versions of it: one with a
picture of a dog in it and one with a picture of a car. Well branching comes to
the rescue! Just create two branches and create a new desired version on each
branch.

Branching is a huge topic in Git and requires an entire book just for what you
can do with branches and how to manage them.

** Merging
What if your branches diverge too much? Merge them!

Merging works best with plain text files, see why in [[*Binary vs plain text files]]

* Why you need Git
If you do anything on a computer you need to learn how to use Git, I'd even go
as far as saying that is should be a basic skill everyone needs to know. It
takes few hours to learn the basics and no more than few days to get used to it,
but the outcome is astonishing: no more versioned files in the project
directory, no more fear of losing data and collaborating is way easier.

The preferred way of learning Git is through the command line. If you're not
familiar with it, Git also comes with a handy user interface with all the basic
buttons you need. And if you don't like the one that comes by default, don't
worry, there are tons of them out there!

If you wish to take a ride into the Git world, there is a cool game called [[https://ohmygit.org][Oh my
Git]]. It covers all the basics in a funny and entertaining way.

* Binary vs plain text files
One thing to say, Git works best with plain text files, and that's the reason
why I tried to move away from binary files as much as I could. You can't merge
binary files without breaking something, although not every file can be used as
a plain text file. Don't get me wrong, Git *does* work with binary files and I
still recommend to do it, as a fact you can stage them, commit them and checkout
new and old revisions, you just can't get every cool feature that it offers. I
could keep talking about why you should move to plain text files when writing
anything on a computer but I'll keep this for another day.

** Files which are plain text include:
- ~txt~ files
- Most programming languages source code
- Markdown files
- Org-mode files (the one I'm writing on right now)
- Literally any other file which when opened with notepad and doesn't produce
  gibberish.
  
** Files which are *not* plain text include:
- PDFs
- Every Microsoft Office document type
- Most closed source programming languages
- Mechanical drawings
- Images
- Videos
- Specific programs files

* Conclusions
To summarize:
- Git offers an opportunity to get rid of all your headaches when working on a
  computer.
- You need to learn Git if you want to easily collaborate and share files.
- It's easy to learn and there is a game called [[https://ohmygit.org][Oh my git]] which covers all the basics.
- Binary files won't give you as much flexibility as plain text files.
