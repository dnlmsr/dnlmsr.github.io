## What are dotfiles
For those who aren't familiar with Linux environments, dotfiles are those files
and directories which sit in your `/home/user/` directory. Those file always
start with a dot, hence the name. They usually contain user-specific data, such
as personal configurations, data, or cache files.

## My dotfiles
You can download my dotfiles from [GitHub](https://github.com/dnlmsr/dotfiles).
I use [yadm](https://yadm.io) as my dotfiles manager, because it is pretty
straight forward to use if you're familiar with git. I strive to keep my
dotfiles tidy and properly documented, if something is missing don't hesitate to
contact me or open a new issue.

## XDG Base Directory Specification

> A clean `/home/` is a happy `/home/`

I try to keep my home directory clean by supporting the [XDG Base Directory
Specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html),
which i totally suggest to do.
