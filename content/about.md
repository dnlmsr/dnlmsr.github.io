# Why I own my website
Simple answer: I got tired of social media and wanted to create a space where I
could express myself in total freedom. Owning a website means owning your
content, so I'm not worried of some third party company using my data for their
income.

# How is this website built
Originally, this website was build using emacs org-mode. However, the more I
tried to customize it, the harder it became. So I decided to migrate to HUGO. No
bloated themes, no javascript, and definitely no trackers. Just plain and simple
html with a small bit of css thanks to simplecss.

# Why I don't use javascript
Web is bloated. Like seriously, I'm tired of all those cookie popups, trackers,
bloat, advertisements and other junk that comes with today's websites. This
website only features a simple css theme (literally simplecss), and plain html.
No javascript whatsoever. There are 2 main reasons for why I decided to not use
javascript in my website:

## I don't need it
And why would your website even need it? If your goal is just showing content to
the public, why do you need tons of cookies or trackers? This website features
no trackers, no Google Analytics, no adv, and probably never will.

## It slows down the web experience
If Moore's law is true, then why are sites loading only a tiny fraction faster
(sometimes even slower) than 15 years ago? Websites and softwares are getting
more resource demanding. My goal is to use as less resources as possible to make
my content accessible to most people.
